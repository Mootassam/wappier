These prices are unlikely to change once set, because publishers tend to think price adjustments alienate existing players. While these fears are understandable, they are far from justified. In fact, publishers maximize engagement and revenue when they optimize IAP prices to reflect the reality of global player bases.<\/p><p>In short, if you localize your game\u2019s language, why wouldn\u2019t you also localize its prices to local demand?<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2094047 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"2094047\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2>What Is Localized Pricing?<\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-fb1c524 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"fb1c524\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Localized pricing is the lowering and raising of IAP prices to reflect the economic conditions within a player\u2019s home country. The logic is simple: Players are more likely to purchase IAPs with prices aligned to the value they offer relative to the rest of their purchasing lives. Those living in developing economies will buy IAPs primarily at a reduced price point. Meanwhile, players from highly-developed economies have more spending power and a higher willingness to buy standard or higher-priced IAPs.<\/p><p>Traditionally, most publishers follow the \u201cone size fits all\u201d price model. Even game companies that invest heavily in localization opt to use the App Store\u2019s currency exchange to assign regional prices automatically. Unfortunately, this approach is limiting for players and publishers \u2014 it fails to account for differences in purchasing power caused by factors like GDP, unemployment, and many others. As a result, even profitable apps with standard models price out too many players around the world.<\/p><p>Localized pricing, however, prices each IAP against pricing elasticities for the target country, increasing the likelihood of meeting every player\u2019s willingness to purchase. When publishers apply these models consistently, they see corresponding gains in engagement, revenue, and player community growth.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1343a51 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"1343a51\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Localized Pricing and Player Engagement<\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1fd4a25 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"1fd4a25\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>We\u2019ve seen the results of localized pricing ourselves, and it\u2019s not just increased revenue: Engagement benefits as well. At wappier, we use our <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/wappier.com\/global-pricing\/\">Global Pricing<\/a> <\/strong>product to analyze the micro and macroeconomic factors that influence willingness to pay. Then, when the platform has enough data, it calculates the precise price optimizations by country that maximize engagement. These models are so accurate that we can account for differences in purchasing power between countries that share a currency, such as individual nations in the European Union.<\/p><p>A recent analysis of wappier data shows that localized pricing has the following impacts on player behavior:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Average Days of Activity per month:<\/strong> Publishers who participate in the global pricing program see player activity increase each month by 7.5%- 11.5%.<\/li><li><strong>Time to First Purchase:<\/strong> When users are offered localized prices, they spend 12%-24% less time considering their first purchase.<\/li><li><strong>Time to Second Purchase:<\/strong> Once users have made their first localized purchase, they are more likely to continue engaging with the app. The time between their first and second transactions decreases by 11%-33%.<\/li><\/ul><p>These figures suggest that players are far more engaged with apps when IAP prices reflect their willingness to pay \u2014 even if that price varies by region. More importantly, these results occur regardless of the influence of other marketing efforts, such as promoting seasonal events to trigger short-term purchase increases.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3e310a1 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"3e310a1\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Localized Pricing and Revenue<\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-08ee745 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"08ee745\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>It\u2019s important to remember that localized pricing drives a corresponding increase in revenue, not just transaction frequency. At wappier, we\u2019ve seen publishers earn 20%-40% more revenue by adjusting prices on per country level outside the US. These adjustments do not rely on private customer data \u2014 wappier uses publicly available datasets that include a country\u2019s GDP, currency exchange rates, and other economic indicators combined with device penetration, game statistics and more in order to create a wappier Index of price elasticities for mobile game purchases across countries.<\/p><p>Since 2018, wappier has used its Global Pricing product <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XaBFrLl02a4\">to optimize IAP prices<\/a> <\/strong>for a high-profile casino game in multiple countries. In the process, we projected new demand curves for countries outside the US, allowing for more precise localized pricing. As a result, after three months, the game dramatically increased its ARPU, with the highest gains coming from developing countries.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Global average:<\/strong> 55%<\/li><li><strong>Peru:<\/strong> 138%<\/li><li><strong>Romania:<\/strong> 136%<\/li><li><strong>Hungary:<\/strong> 129%<\/li><li><strong>Ukraine:<\/strong> 129%<\/li><li><strong>Poland:<\/strong> 96%<\/li><li><strong>Czechia:<\/strong> 95%<\/li><li><strong>Germany:<\/strong> 81%<\/li><\/ul><p>These ARPU increases reveal two critical insights. First, lower prices drive an influx of payer conversions in developing economies. Second, publishers can still increase revenue in highly-developed economies like Germany by matching IAPs to the region\u2019s willingness to pay.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1c8da8f elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"1c8da8f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Localized Pricing for Every Player<\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d756975 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"d756975\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Economic indicators are not the only factors that contribute to localized pricing models.
