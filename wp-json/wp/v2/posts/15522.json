As the story goes, some developers brought their game to Pincus for possible investment. He ultimately didn\u2019t invest because while he enjoyed playing it at the time, he \u201cdidn\u2019t dream about it.\u201d Jeremy said he uses that idea of dreaming with regard to long-term retention. \u201cWhat gets you dreaming about accomplishing more?\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s the gameplay itself, the desire to increase skill or reach a new level, and sometimes it\u2019s new content. Whatever it is, if your game doesn\u2019t have that thing that makes players think about your game when they\u2019re not playing it, your long-term retention will suffer.<\/p><p>There\u2019s no long-term retention without persuading players to stick with your game in the short term, but reliable metrics can be scarce in those first few days. Sophie shared that she examines playtime and session length to get a feel for how well a game\u2019s short-term stickiness is working. A daily playtime of around an hour is highly encouraging, less than that may indicate a problem with your onboarding.<\/p><p>Robin shared that one of the things Hutch has learned across its portfolio of games is the importance of teaching one thing at a time. The goal is to teach the player enough to give them competency, but not so much that they get overwhelmed: \u201cYou can lose a lot of players within the first ten minutes, so it\u2019s that balance of to what extent you want to handhold players through the basic mechanics, versus giving them the knowledge to succeed.\u201d<\/p><p>A game\u2019s difficulty curve may also be a reason behind a sudden user dropoff. Jeremy suggested using the ratio of attempts to successes per level or per block of levels and correlating that with churn. Sophie added that the ratio matters both ways: a game can be too difficult and it can also be too easy. If players are sailing through those first levels they may feel like the game isn\u2019t worth their attention and leave.\u00a0<\/p><p>Our experts had some specific advice for how to give your game the best chance at retaining players. Sophie spoke of the power of good sessioning, saying, \u201ca feeling of achievement or completion\u201d created by a natural stopping point lets players feel good about their experience. They\u2019re not exhausted by their playtime and instead feel accomplished and excited about the next time they get to play. Robin echoed that by discussing players having the agency to make progress by cashing in their rewards or using their energy at the start of a new session, as it\u2019s a strong reason to return to the game. Top Drives\u2019 players have held Hutch to account \u201cwhen it comes to the instant gratification of rewards when they\u2019re doing any activity,\u201d which speaks to Robin about their emotional investment in the game.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0ca457d elementor-hidden-desktop elementor-hidden-tablet elementor-hidden-phone elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"0ca457d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/resources.wappier.com\/ultimate-guide-to-mobile-game-retention\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/wappier-RetentionGuide-Social-V1-1024x538.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-image-15022\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/wappier-RetentionGuide-Social-V1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/wappier-RetentionGuide-Social-V1-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/wappier-RetentionGuide-Social-V1-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/wappier-RetentionGuide-Social-V1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-357b982 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"357b982\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h1><span lang=\"EN\">Retention vs. monetization: What to tackle first<\/span><\/h1>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-99b0174 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"99b0174\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>One of the things wappier does for game developers is help them determine the best pricing for their in-app purchases, but often I\u2019ll have partners say to me that they\u2019ll only worry about pricing after they\u2019ve fixed their retention. The panel agreed that retention was obviously vital, but cautioned against trying to consider monetization too late into a game\u2019s lifespan. Sophie said that if you have to choose one or the other, then retention is the way to go, but that it shouldn\u2019t be an either\/or situation. Have some version of a monetization strategy present from the very beginning, because \u201cyou can always optimize [it] later,\u201d something that can\u2019t be done with retention.<\/p><p>That said, there may be opportunities for monetization even if you\u2019re struggling with retention. Robin shared that Hutch discovered a later game retention cohort for Top Drives and chose to gear their monetization strategy towards them, rather than continuing to woo newer players. At that moment, it was \u201ceasier to build on our strengths than tackle our weaknesses,\u201d a strategy that paid off with higher spend and engagement due to being centered on improving live ops offerings and developing loyalty features like daily rewards.<\/p><p>If you\u2019re planning to monetize with ads, you absolutely have to be thinking about retention at the same time, said Jeremy, because ads are \u201cbasically a point in your game to churn.\u201d There are financial benefits when interstitials or rewarded video ads persuade your players to try a different game, but \u201cevery penny you make out of it has to be worth it in terms of retention.\u201d SYBO is adding IAPs to its hugely successful, mostly ad-supported Subway Surfers, which has racked up 3 billion downloads to date, and while Jeremy couldn\u2019t share specifics about it, he did say IAPs are a good measure of overall game health, a vital metric for a 9-year-old game.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4737b03 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"4737b03\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">The best monetization strategy for 2021<\/h1>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-99b99fa elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"99b99fa\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Crafting the best monetization strategy starts with knowing what motivates your audience, what they care about. Perhaps it\u2019s to make more progress, or maybe it\u2019s to connect with the story. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t want to sell everything,\u201d cautioned Sophie, because then you don\u2019t have a game. A successful IAP plan is about finding the balance between the quality of the free experience and the perceived value of things that can be enhanced with spend.<\/p><p>Not all games are suited to IAPs, but players have become much more accepting of ads. Sophie would never have considered running a full-screen ad five years ago, but some players want ads. Jeremy agreed, summing it up beautifully: \u201cPeople don\u2019t hate ads, they hate bad content.\u201d<\/p><p>If you want to solve both monetization and retention at the same time, figure out how to work an auction house into your game. That\u2019s Jeremy\u2019s suggestion, based on his personal experience using the companion app for FIFA Ultimate Team. The \u201cmain\u201d game is on his console, but his mobile device is where \u201cmost of the retention\u201d happens as players buy and sell cards from each other in an attempt to increase their in-game wealth. A market of some kind increases players\u2019 perception of the game\u2019s value while also giving them a reason to keep coming back as they check on the value of their own content. \u201cIf you can put an auction house in your game and have it make sense, it is laughable how strong of a retention mechanic that is,\u201d he says.<\/p><p>Thanks so much to\u00a0 Sophie, Robin, and Jeremy for joining me!
