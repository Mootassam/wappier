The App Store&#8217;s commerce and payments system offers developers a range of capabilities and tools to grow their businesses, and the new pricing enhancements will offer even more flexibility and control to price their apps and games.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">That means that developers will now have access to 900 price points, which is nearly 10 times the number of price points previously available. This includes 600 new price points and 100 higher price points that are available upon request. With prices starting as low as $0.29 and going up to $10,000, the App Store offers a wide range of pricing options to accommodate different business models and pricing strategies. The new pricing conventions and rounded price endings will also make it easier for developers to manage bundles and annual plans.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The new pricing enhancements are already available for apps offering auto-renewable subscriptions and will be for all other apps and in-app purchases in spring 2023, giving developers unprecedented flexibility and control over their product pricing in 45 currencies across 175 storefronts.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The App Store&#8217;s pricing upgrade has significant implications for developers, both in terms of opportunities and challenges.
