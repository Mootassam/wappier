Continuing the 2020 trend of virtual panels, I recently moderated a <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalgamesforum.com\/gamesforum-online\/\">Gamesforum Online<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> discussion covering trends in modern mobile gaming. Naturally, we talked about the effect COVID-19 has had on the mobile industry and its employees, as well as monetization strategies, launching in a crowded market, and other challenges facing modern mobile game developers and publishers.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was joined by mobile monetization experts from three of the most prominent mobile game publishers:<\/span><\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pete Staley, Director of User Acquisition, Jam City<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barak David, COO, Murka<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vladimir Funtikov, CEO, Creative Mobile<\/span><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were fortunate to have these folks from these leading game companies share their insights.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you missed the panel, you can watch<\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A6P3FmXeAKI\"> &#8216;Trends in Mobile Gaming Today&#8217;<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in its entirety on YouTube.\u00a0 Or, you can read further for highlights from the discussion about today\u2019s mobile gaming trends. <\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2094047 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"2094047\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2><strong>COVID-19 has its ups and downs<\/strong><\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3363cdf elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"3363cdf\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re now about seven months into the coronavirus outbreak, making 2020 one of the most difficult years in recent memory. While most have struggled with social distancing, remote working, and going stir-crazy, COVID-19 has actually been a boon to the mobile game industry \u2014 at least in the short term.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Barak, the first few months of the pandemic led to a mobile gaming boom of sorts. With people mostly staying indoors for months on end, mobile games provide an easy escape. This led to higher engagement, with even longtime players spending more time in-game. While Jam City didn\u2019t see a huge difference in day-to-day activities, Pete added that organic downloads increased when the lockdowns started.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, that bump has leveled off. Meanwhile, all three companies have been wrestling with working\u00a0 remotely. After all five of Murka\u2019s offices across Europe temporarily closed and employees began working from home, Barak was pleasantly surprised to see increased efficiency across the board. Vladimir had been \u201cfantasizing about a hybrid work model for years,\u201d but before the pandemic, all of Creative Mobile\u2019s employees were fully in the office. Unsurprisingly, when lockdown restrictions in Europe loosened in May, employees weren\u2019t exactly rushing back to the office. The company is now considering letting their employees choose where they work.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side all three panelists lamented the loss of social interaction and spontaneous brainstorming sessions among their teams. Barak said it was harder to keep the company culture active from a distance, since\u00a0 much of the innovation at work came during lunch hours, coffee breaks, and other in-person opportunities that aren\u2019t easy to replicate in a remote environment.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pete also missed the coffee talk over at Jam City, and he\u2019s been making sure to infuse more social chat into virtual meetings. Marketing and user acquisition are particularly brainstorm-heavy departments, so adjusting to 2020\u2019s specific challenges is an ongoing effort.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-34c7ade elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"34c7ade\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2><strong>Unsustainable expectations and iOS 14 are looming challenges<\/strong><\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-dc98e8a elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"dc98e8a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So more people are playing mobile games during the pandemic \u2014 that\u2019s good, right? Sure, but that growth can backfire.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c2021 will be a challenging year,\u201d as Barak put it.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vlad promptly agreed, noting that the perception of continuous growth is \u201cnot sustainable.\u201d Investors\u2019 appetites in the mobile game industry are growing, but so too are their expectations. Meanwhile, the mobile game industry is becoming increasingly crowded resulting in shorter game lifespans.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another challenge looming on the 2021 horizon is iOS 14. While Apple gave mobile developers a <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/johnkoetsier\/2020\/09\/03\/idfa-stay-of-execution-apple-delays-new-ios-14-privacy-measures-until-2021\/#48179351569f\">stay of execution<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the operating system\u2019s new privacy features, the eventual switch to opt-in IDFA permission will change the mobile marketing industry immensely. As I wrote <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wappier.com\/blog\/mobile-gaming-today\">a few months ago<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>,<\/strong> \u201cSome developers fear this update represents a seismic shift in the mobile ad ecosystem.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Director of UA at Jam City, Pete is still figuring out how to \u201croll with that.\u201d The IDFA \u2014 quite literally, Identifier for Advertisers \u2014 is frequently used by marketers, especially in the user acquisition process, to track users and deliver customized advertisements\/ When the changes go into effect sometime next year, the IDFA will be turned off by default, cutting off access to vital, monetizable insights..\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the sky is falling,\u201d Pete said. Though marketers will no longer be able to leverage in-app purchase history to target players, advertising costs may level off as well. Marketing could shift to a more \u201cprobabilistic\u201d model with new data sources. Jam City is currently in the process of exploring new advertising channels, though Pete couldn\u2019t get into specifics about that.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe market must be balanced,\u201d Barak added. Advertising costs cannot continue to rise without delivering results. Murka uses a dedicated data science team to predict conversions and other metrics, that may prove more important than ever in a post-IDFA world.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-91fc3f8 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"91fc3f8\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2><strong>Knowing your players is the #1 tip for launching new games<\/strong><\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-9c2185f elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"9c2185f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I mentioned, the mobile market is crowded. We\u2019re also seeing many of the same games retain their positions on mobile stores\u2019 top 10 and top 100 listings. Breaking through with something new is tough, and you have to know how to grab your players\u2019 their attention.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat are their motivations, behaviors? What are the demographics?\u201d These are the questions mobile developers and marketers must be asking themselves. Marketers need to match their player personas with the right advertising channels, which necessitates knowing their reach and targeting capabilities.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pete added, \u201cCreative is one of the most powerful tools a marketer has.\u201d Creative strategy and messaging are vital for user acquisition, as the creative message showcases a game\u2019s value proposition.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And how about retaining those new users? \u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d Barak responded. Games need to find the right balance between gameplay and monetization; the in-app economy is one of the most important factors in an app\u2019s long-term success. He suggested adding new content daily, making players feel like they\u2019re missing out every day that they\u2019re not in the game. Vlad enthusiastically agreed with Barak, highlighting the importance of promoted battle passes, event passes, and subscriptions, which offer flexibility. \u201cI really like the concept of games having multiple reward tracks,\u201d Vladimir said. He also noted that communication with the player about pricing models should be clear: \u201cUltimately I want to be as upfront and honest and transparent about the pricing\u2026 as we can.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jam City has had success with the battle pass model, Pete added. Earlier this year, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">added a \u201cMagical Milestones\u201d pass with additional rewards and new themes every month.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-9b44f21 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"9b44f21\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2><strong>\u201cGames are always a work in progress\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-53eeee4 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"53eeee4\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we wrapped up the panel, Pete gave us one last piece of advice for game developers and marketers: \u201cGames are always a work in progress. Games are always ongoing. Development is ongoing.\u201d New titles might take some time to break through the established market, but that\u2019s okay. What\u2019s important is listening to the audience and adapting to make the gameplay experience as enjoyable as possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big thanks to\u00a0 Pete, Vlad, and Barak for joining me on this informative panel!
