Yet, despite its importance to the bottom line, most game developers have a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to pricing.\u00a0 Many even treat it as an afterthought \u2013 something to be decided just before launch.<\/p><p>This is a real missed opportunity. The right price is what someone is willing to pay for it. Afterall, this is a digital good with no marginal cost associated with its utility.<\/p><p>So, why the resistance?\u00a0<\/p><p>Well, this question is best answered with their main concern: \u201c<strong>What if my players find out?\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p><p>The underlying fear for game developers is that if their players discover disparate pricing, it will provoke a community backlash that players will withhold their money in protest; seek competing titles with \u201cmore ethical\u201d pricing; and, even worse, vent their frustrations\u00a0 on message boards, subsequently, earning the scorn of even more players (that probably never intended to buy anything).<\/p><p>While my tongue is firmly planted in cheek, this fear of community backlash is one of the reasons why many game developers resist differential pricing.\u00a0 Clearly not all publishers.\u00a0 Games at the top of the charts are doing some pretty sophisticated stuff when it comes to pricing \u2013 with no community backlash.\u00a0 In fact, they are consistently at the top of the charts and have been for years.\u00a0 We know because we work with some of them.<\/p><p>To achieve these same results, developers need to stop lumping all pricing strategies together and recognize that community building and monetization are in fact complementary disciplines. It starts with understanding the difference between dynamic pricing and global pricing.<\/p><p>\u2018Dynamic pricing,\u2019 where prices change from one second to the next, or environments in which players experience dramatically increasing prices as they progress in the game, may rightfully earn the ire of players.\u00a0<\/p><p>There are other, better differential pricing strategies, mobile developers can employ differential pricing \u00a0that are not so controversial and actually improve the experience for more players.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2094047 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"2094047\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2><strong>Global Pricing: Invite the World to Play<\/strong><\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3363cdf elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"3363cdf\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>It is perfectly reasonable that prices are lower in other countries than the United States.\u00a0 In fact, I think it is unfair to charge your global community the same as Americans. Take Brazil for example. While Brazil is home to a substantial number of mobile gamers, the average income is relatively low compared to other countries. Applying the same pricing tiers to Brazilian players as you would to those in the US not only adds friction to the conversion funnel, it neglects the opportunity to cultivate a core fanbase of devoted paying players.\u00a0 Simply put, most IAP pricing is overpriced for the majority of players around the world.\u00a0 This notion of fairness is why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/479415\/app-store-gets-flexible-pricing-tiers-europe\/\"><strong>Apple introduced alternative pricing tiers<\/strong><\/a> a while back enabling lower prices in select countries.\u00a0 Google has also promoted the idea that pricing should be localized and makes it easier with <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/6334373?hl=en\">pricing templates<\/a> <\/strong>while also offering sub 99 cent pricing in select countries.<\/p><p>We take for granted that pricing may vary by location or that prices might change due to a special event like a sale. I believe that the vast majority of people expect that there is some differential pricing in mobile games.<\/p><p>We here at wappier help game developers optimize IAP pricing on a per country basis so that they can foster engagement with more players, build stronger communities, and generate more revenue. We\u2019ve consistently seen first-hand that when pricing is attuned to local purchasing power, there is a dramatic increase in number of payers and overall transactions, resulting in greater overall IAP revenue. The resulting game economy is more robust and relies less on a small concentration of high-value whales.<\/p><p>If interested you can <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/wappier.com\/global-pricing\/\">learn more about Global Pricing<\/a><\/strong> on our website<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-34c7ade elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"34c7ade\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Offer-based pricing<\/span><\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-dc98e8a elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"dc98e8a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Another opportunity is offer-based pricing.\u00a0 Here we leverage insights into player engagement and predictive LTV to segment players and target offers based on willingness to spend.\u00a0 \u00a0As long as you are not constantly changing storefront pricing, you have a lot of room to make pricing adjustments with offer-based pricing.\u00a0<\/p><p>The idea of a \u201cstarter pack\u201d or first purchase discount is a great way to convert a player into a payer sooner than later resulting in greater retention and lifetime value. Since the player has no prior experience with pricing the right price is what is presented.\u00a0<\/p><p>Similarly, in-game sale promotions are well established (<em>Loyal player, Lifecycle pricing, Daily Offer, Holiday Sale, Happy hour) <\/em>and are good opportunities for targeted pricing.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p><p>Here there is little risk of people noticing differential pricing.\u00a0 After all, purchases tend to be impulse buys made on the spot according to perceived notions of value.\u00a0 People will only talk about changes in pricing if they notice changes to regular pricing, and expect sale prices to vary.\u00a0<\/p><p>Almost everyone accepts the idea of volume discounts. If you\u2019re willing to buy a bigger quantity of coins, you almost always get a better unit price. Presenting these as a special offer or bundle is a great way to entice a larger purchase from payer. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-799b3a2 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"799b3a2\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"743\" src=\"https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/EIKASTIKO-1024x743.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-image-14645\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/EIKASTIKO-1024x743.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/EIKASTIKO-300x218.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/EIKASTIKO-768x558.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/EIKASTIKO-1536x1115.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/EIKASTIKO.jpg 1774w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-91fc3f8 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"91fc3f8\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2><span lang=\"EN\">Summary<\/span><\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-9c2185f elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"9c2185f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Getting your pricing right is key to maximizing revenue and making sure that investments into your game continue to pay off for the long run. \u00a0This has become particularly vital \u00a0as the price of acquiring users becomes increasingly more expensive, and especially challenging to make first time players convert their first in-app purchase.\u00a0<\/p><p>There is also no reason to fear a community backlash as long as you are reasonable in your pricing and you message your offers appropriately.
