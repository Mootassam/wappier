It doesn\u2019t matter if your app is in the concept stage or ready for launch; developers must consider how your game will generate revenue. \u201cYou can\u2019t pay your Facebook UA bills with retention,\u201d Vladimir admits.<\/span><\/p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start with market research<\/span><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every successful mobile game starts with market research. \u201cKnow what you want [to create] \u2014 what genre, what demographics, these types of things,\u201d Patrick says. \u201cFrom there, you can spot some of the gaps or areas in the market that can be addressed.\u201d<\/span><\/p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use soft launches to test-drive monetization strategies<\/span><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a mobile game launch, the last thing you want to be doing is redesigning a flawed game economy. Vladimir suggests that even an in-development game should meet the criteria for \u201cminimum viable monetization.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going deeper, he explains that if you check a number of boxes, you can run ROI-positive UA campaigns on a small scale, long before your game is complete and full of great content. So in the early stages, developers should actively look for three things: The core emotions that the game delivers, good ways to monetize the experience, and good UA performance. Laying these foundations is a better strategy than pinning hopes on retention turning into revenue once you begin to monetize.<\/span><\/p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your players are people \u2014 treat them like it!<\/span><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking at spreadsheets of user data, sometimes it\u2019s easy to overlook that each data point comes from a complex human being. If you hope to monetize your mobile game, it\u2019s a crucial factor to keep in mind.<\/span><\/p><ul><li><b><b>Play to emotions using context:<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cWe are primarily in the business of selling emotions,\u201d Vladimir says. \u201cYou need two things in mobile F2P to make it work \u2014 content and context.\u201d<\/span><\/b><\/b><p>\u00a0<\/p><\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Make the value proposition clear:<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cA confused player will not pay, so you need to give them the clarity \u2014 not just the value \u2014 so the user understands what they are buying and why it is the best thing now,\u201d Simo notes.<\/span><\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e26afe6 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"e26afe6\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2.

A developer who chooses Tier 1 grants its product a USD value of $0.99 and a JPY value of \u00a5120. The actual conversion rate between the two currencies at the time the IAP price is set is not taken into consideration.<\/p><p>The benefit of this effect is that prices remain constant despite market fluctuations. If a player completes the same IAP every week, that price will not fluctuate within their preferred currency. Apple will periodically revise these numbers to reflect any strengthening or weakening currencies, but these instances are rare and do not apply to the entire tier.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-9efaf08 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"9efaf08\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2><strong>3.

In the United States, a single Tier 1 purchase worth $0.99 will award the developer $0.70.<\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertisements and <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wappier.com\/blog\/in-app-purchases\/\">in-app purchases<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> represent the core revenue channels of any successful app. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to choose between them: Ads and IAPs work in tandem.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have both in our games, and both contribute very strongly to our bottom line,\u201d Patrick says. \u201cYou can design around economic benefits and the value proposition of \u2018hey, watch this ad and get things that help you progress\u2019. And of course, the IAPs should expedite that progression.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, Vladimir cautions, developers should exercise discernment with rewarded ads. \u201cRewarded ads can definitely cannibalize IAP if you don\u2019t keep the larger picture of your economy in mind,\u201d Vladimir says. His games have a few strategic rewarded video placements, but the key is to strike the right balance.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-605916f elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"605916f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4.

Developers need to find ways to make their game appeal over the long term without compromising what makes the experience so popular. Thankfully, the panelists offered some valuable insights.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in retention<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the webinar, Simo shared a story about growing the game Hotel Hideaway from 300 thousand to one million MAU in under a year. The primary lesson here: Invest in long-term retention, not just UA. &#8220;[The] key was perseverance and steadiness, and slowly chugging along because our long-term retention is really high,\u201d Simo explained.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While retention drove their core strategy, global UA also contributed to Hotel Hideaway\u2019s rapid growth. \u201cA big surprise for us was Southeast Asia \u2026 even though [Hotel Hideaway] was really made for a US market, we started testing in Indonesia and Thailand and went viral there.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make micro-optimizations instead of sweeping changes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the same slow-and-steady note, Vladimir explained that small changes have a far more significant impact than massive overhauls. Developers should make micro-optimizations instead of trying to reinvent the wheel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSmall updates did all the work for us,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve become skeptical about people pitching fundamental changes \u2026 what gave us 2.5x-3x LTV growth and 7x revenue growth was a series of minor tweaks.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lean into segmentation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, developers should use tools that make it easier to manage each target audience. On a global scale, player behaviors will be far more varied, and <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wappier.com\/blog\/data-visualization-for-mobile-games\/\">advanced segmentation tools<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne of the more interesting things we\u2019re doing now is using AI to generate new purchases for the players,\u201d Vladimir said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen transparent and consistent increases of 10-20% revenue on top of baseline [when we] take a lot of data points and subtly tweak the offers we\u2019re presenting to different users.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-9a7ad8c elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"9a7ad8c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2><strong>5. Keep your eye on the next evolution of F2P<\/strong><\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-65d8e67 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"65d8e67\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there\u2019s one rule in the mobile industry, it\u2019s that everything will change. In a relatively short period, mobile games have expanded from one-time App Store purchases to F2P games with multiple monetization channels. For that reason, our panelists weighed in on trends we can expect in the future:<\/span><\/p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Battle passes and loot boxes<\/span><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, F2P games have relied on <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wappier.com\/blog\/behavioral-economics-in-f2p-game-design\/\">loot boxes<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>,<\/strong> but today, they\u2019re criticized as a predatory practice that unfairly leverages gambling systems. While loot boxes are unlikely to disappear, the panelists agreed that self-regulation is crucial, making sure that loot boxes are not predatory, before government bodies with no understanding of gaming step in and regulate.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, as the subscription economy grows, offers like battle passes are increasingly popular. Battle passes provide additional content by rewarding players for completing specific challenges. It can be purchased through microtransactions or structured like a subscription. \u201cI think they really open up a new type of payer&#8230;\u201d Simo said. \u201cAnd it fits almost any type of game, which is really cool.\u201d<\/span><\/p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mid-core\/core merger<\/span><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mobile platforms host a broader range of game types, we\u2019re slowly starting to see markets overlap. Most notably, traditional mechanics from core games are blending with mid-core experiences to form something new.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve seen is that many mid-core games have received all these social groups and group competitive play, which are definitely core features,\u201d Simo noted. \u201cAnd that&#8217;s one of the most untapped potentials I see that could be heavily monetized is group competition. On the social side, you have this top one percent of payers who basically use as much money as they want as long as they win the competition. And during these competitions maybe you could help yourself win by buying gifts for your teammates\u2026 As we mentioned earlier, selling emotions is one of the best ways to sell, so maybe with that, you could make yourself be really good because A. you win, and B. you make your friend feel really good because they got a lot of free stuff\u2026 so I think [we will see more] gifting.\u201d<\/span><\/p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monetization will improve industry-wide<\/span><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile monetization will continue to evolve and improve, and the benefits will be industry-wide. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get so much better at F2P game monetization,\u201d Vladimir explained. In his view, the industry is somewhat risk-averse today: We innovate a little, then get scared and rely on proven building blocks. Then once we gain some traction and a degree of freedom, we consider it a job-well-done, instead of finding more creative ways to further improve the business model.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMany more conventional businesses are much better at monetizing their audience with less sophisticated tools,\u201d Vladimir admitted. \u201cWe still have a lot to learn\u2026 but my prediction is we&#8217;re gonna get<\/span><b> good<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So get ready to get good.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe it or not, this is just a glimpse of the insights from the Games Forum panel.
