It typically uses machine learning and AI platforms to create the most accurate predictions and then tailor offers for specific customers. Here are just a few next best offer examples:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Retail: <\/strong>A consumer buys an air purifier and is then shown ads for replaceable filters compatible with the exact model they just bought.

They\u2019re going to need filters eventually, so they take advantage of the discount.<\/li><li><strong>Telecommunications: <\/strong>After analyzing a customer\u2019s data usage, a cellular provider sends them a limited-time offer for a plan with more data. Since this helps the user avoid data overage charges, they accept.<\/li><li><strong>Mobile: <\/strong>A mobile game publisher\u2019s analysis shows that players who get to a certain level are more likely to make in-app purchases, so they offer users nearing that level a boost.

That said, it can go awry without a solid strategy in place. Here are some things to consider when implementing the next best offer model:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Know your goals. <\/strong>What is the desired outcome of a next best offer campaign? Are you trying to increase sales, acquire new users, or boost retention? By answering those questions you\u2019ll be able to hone your offers to meet your objectives while still giving the consumer what they need.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gather a lot of data. <\/strong>Precise predictions require a mountain of data about consumer buying habits, as well as the ability to analyze all of that information. Otherwise, you\u2019re just guessing, and that\u2019s not nearly as accurate or effective.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be sensitive. <\/strong>Not every topic is a marketing opportunity. Consumers don\u2019t want to be bombarded with \u201cspecial offer\u201d notices when they\u2019re going through crises or dealing with serious health issues. A next best offer like Target\u2019s rumored pregnancy prediction could have disastrous results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Find the right partner. <\/strong>If you don\u2019t have an in-house machine-learning platform, you may need to partner with another company to take your personalized marketing to the next level. Find a partner that knows your industry well and offers advanced AI solutions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Personalized marketing is constantly evolving, but being able to deliver tailored offers and solutions to consumers is worth it. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\/blog\/personalization-statistics\">Data overwhelmingly shows<\/a><\/strong> that personalized marketing yields better results: more links clicked, more conversions tracked, more revenue generated, and better customer lifetime value optimization. Next best offer is just one way to personalize, but its importance shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to incorporate the next best offer model into your mobile strategy, <b>wappier <\/b>can help!
