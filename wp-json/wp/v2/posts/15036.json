To kick things off, can you speak to the design of <i>June\u2019s Journey<\/i>?

It was fairly successful, and they realized that the hidden object genre was largely untapped in the modern free-to-play mobile format. Hidden object games were huge when internet gaming first started, but as mobile gaming overtook platforms like web and Facebook games, the genre was left behind.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Wooga made <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearl\u2019s Peril<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the developers realized that they could do something that no one else was doing. They came up with a gameplay loop that encouraged building up an island while progressing through the story and discovered that it tied into the core loop really well. After they saw the early results of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearl\u2019s Peril<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it was obvious that they were on to something that was sustainable. So the idea behind <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June\u2019s Journey <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">started with wanting to further optimize <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearl\u2019s<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gameplay loop. And because of that experience with <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearl\u2019s Peril<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Wooga got a critical head start compared to others in the industry looking to build hidden object games.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-ee3458b elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"ee3458b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3><strong>Did you have demographics or a target audience in mind when creating <i>June\u2019s Journey<\/i>?

We had a really, really good understanding of the demographic, and we refined the story and the beats with that demographic in mind.

You actually cannot lose in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June\u2019s Journey<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This kind of gameplay was a key differentiator for our demographic, which on average is around 55-years old and predominantly female. This is something that a lot of our younger creators were testing with their parents, and we found that unlike younger gamers, our audience isn\u2019t really interested in grind-based gameplay.

Our soft launch was really about content cadence: Could we promise an amount of content releases that we could actually keep up with? How fast are players burning through this content? How much are we going to have to create on a weekly cadence? And are we prepared in six months if the soft launch doesn\u2019t go well? Are we ready for a worldwide release?<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually joined Wooga the month of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June\u2019s Journey <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launch, so that was an interesting time. The game starts with a cut scene, and then there\u2019s a good minute of dialogue, and by the time you\u2019re actually playing the game, minutes have passed. When we first started running surveys in games, we found that the majority of our players didn\u2019t identify as gamers\u2026 while answering a survey <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inside a game<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since then, the mobile audience has become much more comfortable with identifying as gamers, so Wooga wants to make sure they\u2019re getting to the actual gameplay as quickly as possible. The entire market has become more savvy, especially in the West, and they just don\u2019t have the patience for long, drawn-out onboarding loops anymore.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-be51e40 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"be51e40\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3><strong>What classic mobile performance stats were you monitoring during the soft launch?

However, one of the fundamentals of the hidden object genre is that they\u2019re long-tail games. The Day 1\u00a0 or Day 7 might not be as high as other mobile games, so we look at Day 14, Day 30, Day 365, and Day 720. We tried to use early data as a proxy to tell us how sustainable the game would be.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have the same approach with revenue KPIs, like ARPDAU, and the soft launch gave us an indicator of what long-term results might look like. At the time, I think the expectations were fairly low as far as what <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June&#8217;s Journey<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ARPDAU could be, as well as what hidden object games could achieve as well. So in that soft launch, we were really scrutinizing retention and engagement metrics, just making sure that the session lengths and daily data cycles were healthy.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months ago, Wooga celebrated <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June\u2019s<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> third anniversary, and there was a fairly large cohort of early players that experienced that anniversary with us.

There was a point in a tutorial where players could click outside of the on-rails experience and find the in-app purchase store, and there was a good portion of players making purchases at this point. So even without an understanding of the value of in-game currencies and items, they were buying first thing. It\u2019s a good problem to have, but it was a head-scratcher.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the level of revenue that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June\u2019s<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has risen to, it&#8217;s more of the sustainable repeat conversions that are driving IAP revenue. I think the SKUs and the store we released were fairly conservative. I would almost liken it to many of these RPG pricing strategies, only without the constant flow of rewards. The reason for that is that the reward space in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June\u2019s Journey<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is fairly tight, so a lot of the in-app purchases have very high in-game economic value. <\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e536965 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"e536965\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/resources.wappier.com\/in-app-purchase-pricing-strategy\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"820\" height=\"423\" src=\"https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IAP-Purchase-pricing.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-image-14604\" alt=\"Cover for IAP Purchase pricing guide\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IAP-Purchase-pricing.jpg 820w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IAP-Purchase-pricing-300x155.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IAP-Purchase-pricing-768x396.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c578d3a elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"c578d3a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3><strong>Did you find that there was a good correlation between retained players and higher-priced bundle conversions?

For many players, their second session was the right time to make a purchase, so the game introduced the first-time purchase bundle. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s there for, right?

If your first purchase is 80% off, you\u2019re going to wait around until the next sale to buy something else. And if there is no sale, they\u2019ll get frustrated and leave. We did a lot of tests around first-time conversions, but it\u2019s fairly hard to have a proper A\/B test on something like this and get conclusive evidence that one thing is better than the other.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-381c2fe elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"381c2fe\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/resources.wappier.com\/ultimate-guide-to-mobile-game-retention\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/wappier-RetentionGuide-Social-V1-1024x538.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-image-15022\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/wappier-RetentionGuide-Social-V1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/wappier-RetentionGuide-Social-V1-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/wappier-RetentionGuide-Social-V1-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wappier.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/wappier-RetentionGuide-Social-V1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-7760441 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"7760441\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3><strong>Were there any other factors that you found correlated to high player value?

We really didn&#8217;t see a higher correlation, one way or the other. One of the things that we\u2019ve noticed is that as the market became more mature, players are getting more comfortable with microtransactions. Western markets in particular have slowly started to get more comfortable with this kind of value proposition. Years ago, if you spent five bucks in a free-to-play game, people would say \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d But now, it\u2019s only five bucks. People pay $15 to see a movie, and that\u2019s only two hours of entertainment.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think as people have gotten more comfortable with this, stats like Facebook-connected users being more valuable slowly went away. This is something that I had seen and Wooga had seen in the past. And so we kept an eye on it.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-6e75a62 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"6e75a62\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3><strong>Folks all over the industry are seeing a diverse reaction to COVID-19 and lockdowns. Some genres are performing better, some are going down. Some are seeing organic acquisition increase, while some are benefitting from paid acquisition.

Are you seeing higher engagement or user acquisition with so many people staying at home?<\/strong><\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0b14cba elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"0b14cba\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the market as a whole benefitted overall those first couple months. From an acquisition standpoint, there were some very quick actors, and those that acted quickly really, really benefited massively. Those first couple of months changed everything, they actually changed the trajectory of some companies. I know a number of games that went from tens of thousands of users a day to hundreds of thousands, simply from ramping up UA; the growth was astronomical.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, of course, because you&#8217;re doing so much paid acquisition, you can expect retention to drop. If you were looking at per-player metrics from a monetization standpoint, they were high at the very beginning and then slowly started to drop as your core audience settled in, and hopefully you\u2019ve grown larger than your initial playerbase. But there were times when we wondered, \u201cIs this dangerous? Did we hit our peaks? Are we dropping too much, is this sustainable? Are we going to plateau and how can we predict when that will happen?\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><br \/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I initially had to worry about was the economic effect, because COVID-19 had some very dramatic results as far as job loss around the world.

The days of relying on just the United States are long gone, and being a top game in the US isn\u2019t enough anymore. One of the basic functions within a game team or company is localization, because it\u2019s 2021, and people want to be able to play games in their native language. But it\u2019s not just a matter of simple translation; there are nuances that can really make a difference. Just look at Spanish \u2014 Mexican Spanish is different from Spanish in Spain. When you start to grow globally you have to keep this stuff in mind. You can\u2019t just rely on English speakers anymore.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other important factor when expanding to a global audience is how your in-game currency measures up to the local economies, which is why we teamed up with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wappier.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>wappier<\/strong><\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the first place. Just look at Brazil \u2014 an in-app purchase that cost the equivalent of $1 a few years ago now costs the equivalent of $6, and that value proposition isn\u2019t good. Realistically, you\u2019re not going to sell anything that way. You need to be able to localize your games for at least the biggest markets around the world.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And no matter what, you don&#8217;t want buyer&#8217;s remorse. That&#8217;s the worst thing that could happen, and you will lose players \u2014 there is no patience for that, because you just took their money and didn\u2019t deliver. At a minimum, they just need to feel that their purchase was a good use of money and time.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think one of the things we&#8217;ll see more of in the future is live events being more localized, not just pricing. For example, I have quite a few friends that live in India, and there are always celebrations happening there. Even just having an event for Lunar New Year is a must nowadays, especially to your Chinese market, but that\u2019s just the start. Every country has its own celebrations; Mother&#8217;s Day and Father&#8217;s Day are different everywhere, and it\u2019s something developers really need to think about in the localization process.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-70d2005 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"70d2005\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3><strong>Do you consistently see that those live events initiatives are worth the time spent on them?<\/strong><\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-998ec86 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"998ec86\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s something that Wooga is still trying to grow into, but it&#8217;s a little awkward when 40% of your user base doesn&#8217;t have Mother&#8217;s Day, and you&#8217;re running a Mother&#8217;s Day event and sale. I think we\u2019ll continue to see this trend grow so players in different regions can celebrate their own local cultural events and feel included. The tricky part is making sure that players globally feel like they\u2019re getting the same benefits, even if they don\u2019t have the same events.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c6f22b8 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"c6f22b8\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Thanks again to Patrick McGrath for chatting with us about <i>June\u2019s Journey <\/i>and the state of the mobile game industry!\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b9b51b6 elementor-align-center elementor-widget elementor-widget-button\" data-id=\"b9b51b6\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"button.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-button-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/lets-talk\" class=\"elementor-button-link elementor-button elementor-size-sm\" role=\"button\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-button-content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-button-text\">Let's Talk<\/span>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Former Wooga Product Lead Patrick McGrath discusses the many nuances of mobile game monetization and localization.
