For this session, he assembled a team of industry veterans to discuss concrete strategies they\u2019ve learned over the years to attract players and keep them engaged.

Users may leave because they perceive the tutorial is getting in the way of their fun. \u201cThe best tutorial is one that doesn\u2019t have to be there at all,\u201d says Marin.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it\u2019s also important to consider the difficulty at the beginning of your game experience, recognizing that \u201cdifficulty\u201d means different things to different players. Even players who may welcome a challenge later still want to feel like they\u2019re making some kind of progress during that first session. \u201cUsually it\u2019s wiser to make it easier upfront so they feel some success before it gets challenging,\u201d says Marin.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-34c7ade elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"34c7ade\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3><strong>2.

You\u2019ll meet a trainer with the coolest one or someone will use one to stop a natural disaster. It becomes a thing players want even though it\u2019s not technically listed as a specific goal.\u201d Looking at your game\u2019s retention data can give you an idea as to what your user base\u2019s intrinsic goals may be, and you could simply ask them for that kind of feedback in your forums or discord.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-91fc3f8 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"91fc3f8\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3><strong>3.

A hyper-casual game, for example, is probably more concerned with D3 than D7 because the game isn\u2019t designed to retain players long term. So in addition to other standard retention metrics, he recommends paying close attention to when the user curve flattens. Every game has a point at which retention drops sharply, but it\u2019s the curve after that, when the user base normalizes, that holds the key information.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEvery game has a very tight flattening of the curve at some point. Whether that is day 7, day 10, day 15. Every game has its own curve where that starts to flatten when your decay rate flattens out. It\u2019s an indicator of the game\u2019s overall health if things start to change around <\/span><b>that<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d he says. If the decay curve normalizes, then drops suddenly, something in the experience needs immediate attention.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-ee3458b elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"ee3458b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3><strong>4.

Except focusing too much on retention can disguise what\u2019s really going on with your user base, says McGrath. If all they\u2019re doing is opening the game, collecting the bonus and leaving, \u201cyour retention\u2019s looking fine, but people aren\u2019t actually engaging.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marin echoed those thoughts by suggesting developers fixate less on a daily log in than on a daily activity. \u201cWe want them to take actions in the game and to get engaged. In Asphalt, we made the conscious decision not to have a daily bonus. Instead, we have a daily goal system.\u201d McGrath followed that with the suggestion that tasks with different difficulty levels set the stage for an \u201cMMO loop\u201d of doing just one more quick task before you log off.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are just some of the points addressed during the chat, which included specific tactics developers can use to improve (or troubleshoot) retention for their mobile game. The panel gets specific about what daily log-in bonuses do wrong, the importance of using arrows, and the psychology of loot boxes.
